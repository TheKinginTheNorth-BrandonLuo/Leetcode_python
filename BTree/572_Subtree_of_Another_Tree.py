572. Subtree of Another Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
